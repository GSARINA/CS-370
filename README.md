Pirate Intelligent Agent
Overview

This project uses reinforcement learning and neural networks to train an intelligent pirate agent to navigate a maze and find treasure. The goal was to apply AI concepts to a real-world problem, showing how an agent can learn and improve through experience.

Project Work

I was given starter code for the maze environment (TreasureMaze.py) and experience replay (GameExperience.py). I implemented the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm, built and trained the neural network model, managed exploration and exploitation, and visualized the agent’s progress in a Jupyter Notebook.

Reflection

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
They solve real-world problems through computing, automation, and data analysis. Their work drives innovation and efficiency in many industries.

How do I approach problems as a computer scientist?
I break problems into smaller steps, research solutions, test different approaches, and refine the results through iteration and feedback.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
AI should enhance human decision-making, not replace it. It’s important to design systems that are transparent, fair, and protect user data while ensuring responsible outcomes.
